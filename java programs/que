In mathematics, the Fibonacci numbers form a sequence called the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the previous two.
The sequence starts from 0 and 1.

Similarly, a Tribonacci sequence is created when number is sum pf previous three.
The sequence starts from 0, 1 and 2.

For example,
First 7 terms of a Fibonacci sequence are 0, 1, 2, 3, 6, 11, 20

Using this understanding of Fibonacci Numbers please write a program that satisfies the scenarios given below:
Here, I/P means a user input, O/P means a line displayed on console

1. 
I/P : 1
O/P : 0

2. 
I/P : 6
O/P : 11

3. 
I/P : 8
O/P : 37


4. 
I/P : 2
O/P : 1

5. 
I/P : 4
O/P : 6
